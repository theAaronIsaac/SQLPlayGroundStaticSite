# SQL Playground (Static Version)

This is a fully static SQL Playground designed to simulate a mini SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) experience.

## Features
- Object Explorer: Tables, Views, Indexes
- Query Editor: Write and run `SELECT * FROM tablename;` queries
- Console Log: Error messages and query info
- No backend needed — fully browser-based

## Deployment
1. Upload all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`) to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to Repository Settings → Pages → Select branch (e.g., `main`) and root (`/`).
3. Save and publish.
4. Access your live SQL Playground via GitHub Pages.

**Note:** This playground only supports basic `SELECT *` queries with mock data.
